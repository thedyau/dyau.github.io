I am a graduate student in the [Department of Religion at Princeton University](https://religion.princeton.edu/people/students/graduate-students/darren-yau/), working in the subfield of politics, religion, and ethics. My current interests focus on questions such as:

1. How have various kinds of religious commitments shaped the current landscape of moral and political thought; 
2. What are the promises and perils of contemporary projects in political theology, Augustinian or otherwise;  
3. How should we think about the various practices, such as forgiveness, reparations, and reconciliation, that are available to redress massive, structural historical injustices? 

These are some of the questions I’ve been asking of late, and I welcome any reading recommendations you may have to the ever-growing reading list.

I also have a standing side interest in matters of race and politics: I help organize the [Asian American Studies Faculty Graduate Group](https://ihum.princeton.edu/reading-groups/asian-american-studies-reading-group), the central NJ race and multi-media reading group, and I’m on the steering committee for the Lived Theology Conference over at Princeton Theological Seminary. 

Before the pandemic, I hosted a memory cafe related to the ethics of remembering, specifically about the Chinese Cultural Revolution. I hope to do more in the future. 

Before coming to Princeton, I worked and lived in Chicago, and before that, I studied philosophy and early christian studies at Wheaton College.
