	    <p> <span>Hello!</span> My name is Darren Yau. I am a <a href="https://religion.princeton.edu/people/students/graduate-students/darren-yau/">graduate student</a> in the Department of Religion at Princeton University, in the <a href="https://religion.princeton.edu/graduate-program/academic-fields/religion-ethics-and-politics/">religion, ethics, and politics</a> subfield.</p>
	      I think and write at the intersection of political theory and religious ethics. Broadly, my research focuses on how religious commitments are shaped by and continue to shape political thought. My current interests include questions such as: </p>
	<ul> 
		<li>How do we make sense of the emergence of non-violent resistance within traditions of theological reflection about violence, just war, self-defense, peace, and resistance?</li>
		<li>How do figures within the Christian theological tradition defend or dissent from liberal accounts of political authority?</li>
		<li>How do theological commitments alter accounts of property rights?</li>
		<li>What are the theological dimensions of the practices of blame and redress, such as reparations and collective acts of repentance?</li>
	</ul>
      <p> These are some of the questions Iâ€™ve been asking of late. </p>
	<p> With several fellow graduate students, I am currently on the steering committee for the Rethinking Just War in the 21st Century Graduate Student Conference at Princeton University. You can read our call for papers <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ex7q0wzf1emrk39/RethinkingJustWar-CFP.pdf?dl=0">here.</a></p>
	<p> I also have a standing interest in matters of race and politics: I helped organize the <a href="https://ihum.princeton.edu/reading-groups/asian-american-studies-reading-group">Asian American Studies Faculty Graduate Group</a> and was on the steering committee for the <a href="https://ltiaa.com/">2021 Lived Theology Conference</a> over at Princeton Theological Seminary. </p>
	<p> Before the pandemic, I hosted a memory cafe related to the ethics of remembering, specifically about the Chinese Cultural Revolution. I hope to do more in the future. </p>
	<p> Before coming to Princeton, I worked and lived in Chicago, and before that, I studied philosophy and early Christian studies. </p>
