      <p> <span>Hello! My name is Darren Yau.</span> I am a <a href="https://religion.princeton.edu/people/students/graduate-students/darren-yau/">graduate student</a> in the Department of Religion at Princeton University, working in the subfield of <a href="https://religion.princeton.edu/graduate-program/academic-fields/religion-ethics-and-politics/">politics, religion, and ethics</a>. My current interests focus on questions such as: </p>
	<ul> 
		<li> How have various kinds of religious commitments shaped the current landscape of moral and political thought; </li>
		<li> What are the promises and perils of contemporary projects in political theology, Augustinian, liberatory, secular, or otherwise; </li>
		<li> How should we think about various practices, such as forgiveness, reparations, and reconciliation, that are available to redress massive, structural historical injustices? </li>
	    </ul>
      <p> These are some of the questions Iâ€™ve been asking of late, and I welcome any reading recommendations you may have to the ever-growing reading list! </p>
	<p> I also have a standing interest in matters of race and politics: I help organize the <a href="https://ihum.princeton.edu/reading-groups/asian-american-studies-reading-group">Asian American Studies Faculty Graduate Group</a>, the central NJ race and multi-media reading group, and the steering committee for the <a href="https://ltiaa.com/">2021 Lived Theology Conference</a> over at Princeton Theological Seminary. </p>
	<p> Before the pandemic, I hosted a memory cafe related to the ethics of remembering, specifically about the Chinese Cultural Revolution. I hope to do more in the future. </p>
	<p> Before coming to Princeton, I worked and lived in Chicago, and before that, I studied philosophy and early christian studies at Wheaton College. </p>
