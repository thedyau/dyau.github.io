	    <p> <span>Hello,</span> My name is Darren Yau. I am a <a href="https://religion.princeton.edu/people/students/graduate-students/darren-yau/">graduate student</a> in the Department of Religion at Princeton University, working in the subfield of <a href="https://religion.princeton.edu/graduate-program/academic-fields/religion-ethics-and-politics/">religion, ethics, and politics.</a>. 
	      I think and write at the intersection of political theory and religious ethics. Broadly, my research focuses on how religious commitments are shaped by and continue to shape political thought, and the promises and perils of various intellectual projects in political theology—Augustinian, liberatory, secular, or otherwise—in the present day. My current interests include questions such as: </p>
	<ul> 
		<li> How do theological traditions defend or dissent from aspects of democratic theory; </li>
		<li> Where non-violent action fits in Christian reflection on violence, peace, war, and resistance; </li>
		<li> How we should think about various practices, such as forgiveness, reparations, and reconciliation, that are available to redress historical injustices.</li>
	    </ul>
      <p> These are some of the questions I’ve been asking of late, and I always welcome any recommendations you may have for the ever-growing reading list! </p>
	<p> I also have a standing interest in matters of race and politics: I help organize the <a href="https://ihum.princeton.edu/reading-groups/asian-american-studies-reading-group">Asian American Studies Faculty Graduate Group</a>, the central NJ race and multi-media reading group, and the steering committee for the <a href="https://ltiaa.com/">2021 Lived Theology Conference</a> over at Princeton Theological Seminary. </p>
	<p> Before the pandemic, I hosted a memory cafe related to the ethics of remembering, specifically about the Chinese Cultural Revolution. I hope to do more in the future. </p>
	<p> Before coming to Princeton, I worked and lived in Chicago, and before that, I studied philosophy and early christian studies at Wheaton College. </p>
